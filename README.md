# Interpreter for SADAL Lang. 
 For this project, I built an interpreter for SADAL, a simplified Ada-like programming language. It parses and executes programs by handling variable declarations, expressions, assignments, conditionals, and basic input/output, following strict type checking and operator precedence rules. I extended a recursive-descent parser from a previous project, added runtime evaluation through a custom Value class, and implemented semantic checks like illegal operations, type mismatches, and division by zero errors. The interpreter reads source code, checks for syntax and runtime errors, and runs programs if everything is valid. I tested it against a full set of clean and error-triggering test cases to make sure it works correctly.
